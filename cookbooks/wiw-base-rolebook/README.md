# wiw-base-rolebook-cookbook

Base instance rolebook.

Given enough time, this is where user account management would happen, most likely using the
[user](http://fnichol.github.io/chef-user/) community cookbook.

Additionally, this is where any other system hardening common across all nodes would take place.

Alas, I'm already over the projected time limit of 4hrs by 2.5hrs, so I will forgo this part.
